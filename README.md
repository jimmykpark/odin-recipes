# odin-recipes
Learning HTML for the past few days, it's time to put all of my 
new-found knowledge together. This file will be my first HTML
project. I will be creating a recipe list and this file will
then be used for future learning (i.e., CSS, JS).

By completion of this project, I will be demonstrating a solid
foundation on HTML, being able to understand and produce proper
syntax, use of code, and organized and clean code. It's time to
develop my best-practices now - to start early and to build good 
habits.
