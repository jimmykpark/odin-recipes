    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        For those of you who are new to this Japanese dish, <strong>donkatsu</strong> 
        consists of tender pork loin (or fillet) that has been breaded and deep-fried 
        to crunchy perfection. The word 'Don' (豚) comes from “pork” and 'Katsu' (カツ) 
        is an abbreviation of 'Katsuretu' (カツレツ), derived from the English word 
        “cutlet.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Like many other popular foods in Japan (think ramen, tempura, soba, etc.), 
        there are donkatsu restaurants that exclusively serve this juicy pork cutlet 
        as their specialty. And no plate of donkatsu is ever complete without a mound 
        of freshly shredded cabbage and a healthy drizzle of donkatsu sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
        Donkatsu is actually one of the quickest and simplest meals you can make at
        home. You just need to know a few tricks to make the perfect donkatsu.
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Donkatsu Pork</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless pork loin chops (½ inch thick) (thickness: 1-1.3 cm, about 
            ½ inch; weight: 100 g, 3.5 oz each piece)</li>
        <li>½ tsp kosher salt (Diamond Crystal; use half for table salt)</li>
        <li>⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>3 cups neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.) 
            (for deep-frying; I recommend 1¾-2 inches (5 cm) of oil in the pot)</li>
    </ul>    
    
    <h4>Donkatsu Breading</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tbsp all-purpose flour (plain flour)</li>
        <li>1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)</li>
        <li>½ Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.) 
            (for the egg)</li>
        <li>½ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs) (If you are in Japan, get nama 
            panko (生パン粉). You may need more panko depending on the brand)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Donkatsu Sesame Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp toasted white sesame seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp toasted black sesame seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp donkatsu sauce (for drizzling over the donkatsu</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Donkatsu Pork</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>With a sharp knife, remove the extra fat and make several 
            slits on the connective tissue (white area) between the meat 
            and fat. Red meat and fat have different elasticities, and 
            when they are cooked, they will shrink and expand at 
            different rates. These slits will allow the donkatsu to stay 
            nice and flat when deep-frying and prevent it from curling 
            up.</li>
        <li>Flip the meat and make several slits on the other side of 
            the connective tissue.</li>
        <li>Pound both sides of the meat with the back of a knife or a 
            meat tenderizer/mallet.</li>
        <li>Mold the meat back into its original shape with your hands.
            </li>
        <li>Season both sides of the meat with salt and pepper.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Donkatsu Breading</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Crack the egg in a deep dish and add the oil.</li>
        <li>Whisk together until it is well mixed</li>
        <li>By adding oil, the meat and breading won't detach from each 
            other while deep-frying and the juice and flavor from the 
            meat will not escape easily.</li>
        <li>Prepare a deep dish for the flour, too.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>Putting the Donkatsu Pork and Donkatsu Breading Together</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Dredge the pork in the flour and dust off any excess. Excess 
            flour will create a coating that prevents the egg mixture 
            from adhering to the pork. Then, dip the pork into the egg 
            mixture and coat well.</li>
        <li>Dredge the pork in the panko, gently pressing down the panko 
            onto the pork and then gently shaking off any excess before 
            placing the pork pieces onto a tray or plate. While deep-
            frying, the panko will “puff up,” so at this stage they don't 
            have to be fluffy. Set it aside for 5-10 minutes so the 
            breading will set.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Deep-Frying the Donkatsu</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the oil to the pot and bring it to 340ºF (170ºC) over 
            medium heat. If you don't have a thermometer, stick a 
            chopstick in the oil and see if tiny bubbles start to appear 
            around the tip of the chopstick. Alternatively, you can drop 
            one piece of panko into the oil; if it sinks down to the 
            middle of the oil and immediately pops back up to the 
            surface, then the oil is ready.</li>
        <li>Gently put one piece of pork into the oil and cook for 1 
            minute (without flipping). Don't touch the pork for 30 
            seconds. Why one piece? You don't want to reduce the oil 
            temperature drastically. The size of the bubbles should be 
            big when you add the pork. Keep watching the oil temperature 
            and make sure it doesn't go over 340ºF (170ºC) or else the 
            breading will get dark too quickly while the pork will be 
            undercooked.</li>
        <li>After a minute, flip the pork and cook the other side for 1 
            minute.</li>
        <li>Take out the pork and remove excess oil by holding it 
            vertically over the pot for a few seconds while the oil drips 
            off. Place it on a wire rack or paper towel and let it sit 
            for 4 minutes. The hot oil on the exterior will slowly 
            continue to cook the meat as it sits.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat temporarily and scoop up and discard any 
            fried crumbs in the oil with a fine-mesh strainer. It's very 
            important to keep the oil clean and crumb free so the oil 
            does not get darker and dirtier with burnt crumbs. Turn on 
            the heat and bring the oil back to 340ºF (170ºC).</li>
        <li>While the first cutlet is resting on the wire rack, deep fry 
            the second piece of pork for 1 minute without flipping. 
            Remember not to touch it for 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Take out the pork and remove the excess oil as before. Place 
            it on the wire rack and let the residual heat cook the pork 
            for 4 minutes. Scoop up and discard the fried crumbs in the 
            oil with a fine-mesh strainer.</li>
        <li>The first piece of pork should be ready for its second 
            frying. Bring the oil to 355ºF (180ºC) and fry the pork for 
            30 seconds on each side. Remove from the pot and drain the 
            excess oil by holding the cutlet vertically over the wire 
            rack or paper towels for 2 minutes. This prevents the 
            breading from getting soggy on one side.</li>
        <li>Scoop up and discard the fried crumbs in the oil, then 
            continue the second frying of the second cutlet. Remove 
            from the pot and drain the excess oil as before.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Donkatsu Sesame Sauce</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Grind the white and black toasted sesame seeds. Leave some 
            seeds 
            ungrounded for texture</li>
        <li>In individual small plates or bowls, serve 1 Tbsp of ground
            sesame seeds and add the donkatsu sauce</li>
        <li>Mix it together when ready to eat</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To Serve</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the donkatsu into ¾-inch (2 cm) wide pieces.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a plate and serve it with the shredded cabbage 
            and cucumber, the sesame dressing in a small cup, and the 
            sesame donkatsu dipping sauce on the side.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy</li>
    </ol>
