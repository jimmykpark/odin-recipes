    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Dashi is a basic stock used in Japanese cooking which is made by boiling 
        dried kelp (seaweed) and dried bonito (fish). Instant dashi granules are 
        sold in conveniently-sized jars or packets and vary in strength. Add more 
        dashi to your soup if you want a stronger stock. You can use yellow, white 
        or red miso paste for this soup. Yellow miso is sweet and creamy, red miso 
        is stronger and saltier.
