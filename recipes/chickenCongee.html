    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        The word "congee" was derived from from the Tamil language of Ancient 
        India, "kanji". In Cantonese, we call it "jÅ«k" (which kinda sounds 
        like "jook"), but there are many, many different variations and names 
        for it across Asia.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even though congee is commonly known as a rice porridge, it wasn't 
        always the case. With thousands of years of history in China, congee 
        was made with whatever grains were available locally: millet, cornmeal, 
        barley, and etc.
